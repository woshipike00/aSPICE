The JNI "glue" code in the android/ directory which is *NOT* directly derived from spice-gtk is licensed
the same way as bVNC, that is, under the GPL v2.

The rest of the code which is either directly derived or unmodified spice-gtk code is licensed under the
LGPL as the original spice-gtk project.
